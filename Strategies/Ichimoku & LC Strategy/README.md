## Entries:
ðŸŸ¢ For a buy
- Lagging line on shift 1 above Span B on shift 26
- Green LC label on shift 1 
- Green Kernel Estimate line on shift 1

ðŸ”´ For a sell
- Lagging line on shift 1 below Span B on shift 26 
- Red LC label on shift 1 
- Red Kernel Estimate line on shift 1

All the entry criterias above are optional. You can combine any of the above entry criterias to form an entry condition. 
Examples: If the Ichimoku condition and LC criteria are selected, an entry will be taken if both the criterias have been met. 
If all 3 criterias are selected, an entry will be taken if all the criterias have been met.
If just 1 of those criterias is selected then an entry will be taken if that has been met.

Along with these criterias, you have 1 other criteria which is a higher timeframe filter (HTF). This will take only buy trades if the latest trade on a higher timeframe is a buy and  only sell trades if the latest trade on a higher timeframe is a sell. 
If you select this, choose the higher timeframe that you want (it must be higher than the chart's current timeframe).

The entry criterias for the higher timeframe entry condition are the same as the entry criterias written above.
You can combine any entry criteria to form an entry condition for higher timeframe entries.
So, if you have selected Ichimoku and Kernel criterias, a higher timeframe entry will be based on those.

The entry criterias for the higher timeframe are completely seperate from the lower timeframe entry criterias. 
You don't have to have the same entry criterias for the higher timeframe and the lower timeframe if you want to have different entry criterias for them.

## Here are the exit conditions:
- TP is based on ratio
- SL is based on Kernel AO Swing
