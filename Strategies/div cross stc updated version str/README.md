## A short description
Credit for the STC indicator - shayankm

Entry condition:
A divergence (Hidden or Regular) should appear before the STC indicator turns red or green. The fast and slow ma have to also be in a buy/sell crossover state at the time of the STC condition.

Exit conditions:
1. STC condition - Entry gets exited once the STC indicator has increased/decreased in value
2. Divergence condition - Entry gets exited once a divergence appears
3. STC & Divergence condition - Entry gets exited once an STC condition has been fulfilled after a divergence condition has been fulfilled
