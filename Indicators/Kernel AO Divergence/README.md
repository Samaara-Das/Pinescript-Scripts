## What does this indator do?
1. Displays swing legs (like Zigzag) based on on the indicator you choose. You can choose from among: AO, MACD, RSI and the Kernel AO Oscillator. Here are the inputs to show/hide these swings:![image](https://github.com/araamas/Pinescript-Scripts/assets/104917239/ed6245a8-a764-4ee6-9403-3501c6569f39)

2. Displays hidden & regular divergences ONLY for the Kernel AO Oscillator. It draws divergences based on 2 different logics:
Logic 1:
Logic 2:

Here are the inputs to show/hide the divergences:![image](https://github.com/araamas/Pinescript-Scripts/assets/104917239/79638677-2a2e-4920-aa1d-d3f508c32b93)

3. Displays range shift. This shades the background based on the RSI. if the RSI is in a bullish range, the background will be green. If it's in a bearish range, the background will be red.

4. Displays Kernel Crossover indicator. They're the fast & slow rational quadratic kernel lines. Here is the input to show/hide it:![image](https://github.com/araamas/Pinescript-Scripts/assets/104917239/2e8d1f0f-e4ba-4a74-bf6c-e9b265502259)
   
5. Displays Nadaraya Watson kernel line (known as the signal line). Here is the input to show/hide it:![image](https://github.com/araamas/Pinescript-Scripts/assets/104917239/ef37e56d-a7af-4faf-a9b0-f0e3db1b3085)

6. Displays LC (Lorentzian Classification). This is jdehorty's Machine Learning: Lorentzian Classification. I have not changed anything in the indicator. This just shows the red/green labels and the Kernel Regression Estimate line. Here is the input to show/hide it:![image](https://github.com/araamas/Pinescript-Scripts/assets/104917239/ee5020cc-e802-4c6b-96e0-a1659bb3c01a)
