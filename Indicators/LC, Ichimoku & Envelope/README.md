## Brief description
This indicator is a combination of LC, Ichimoku and the Envelope indicator. The main reason why this was made was so that the Nadaraya Watson line (which is part of the Envelope indicator) can be used as the source for the LC indicator without filling up the indicator limit by adding the Envelope indicator to the chart. This was also made so that one can view multiple indicators at once and not hit the indicator limit which TradingView imposes.
