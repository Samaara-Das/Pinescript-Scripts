## A brief description
Kernel AO Oscillator is our own custom indicator and is basically the Awesome Oscillator redeveloped using Kernel Regressions. Instead of using 2 Moving Averages for the oscillator's calculation, 2 Kernel Regressions are used. This has its own fast and slow Kernel lines which use the oscillator in its calculations. You can view the oscillator based on a higher timeframe of your choice. The same goes for viewing a lower timeframe version.
