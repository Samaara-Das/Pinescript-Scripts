## A Brief description
This indicator is a combination of 2 indicators: Kernel AO Oscillator and WaveTrend 3D.

This is the same as the "Kernel AO Oscillator indicator" except that it has been combined with WaveTrend 3D. The WaveTrend 3D indicator was created by jdehorty. The main reason that both these indicators were combined was to see 2 indicators at once without filling up the indicator limit.
